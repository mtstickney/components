* Components - System Components for Common Lisp

  Components is a library that implements Stuart Sierra's [[https://github.com/stuartsierra/component][Component]]
  system for managing the lifecycle of system components, but for
  Common Lisp instead of Clojure.

* Status
  This library is currently considered in "alpha" state. The API may
  change without notice, and stability is not guaranteed (but it would
  be pretty hard to mess this up very badly).

* API
  TBD.
